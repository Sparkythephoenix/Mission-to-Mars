# Mission-to-Mars



Purpose
The purpose of this project was in using Web Scraping and various tools needed to extract information from the active websites:

Chrome Developer Tools were used to identify HTML components attached to the wanted data
Beautiful Soup and Splinter were used to automate the web browser and gather the identified data
Mongo was used to store the data from web scrape
To display the data the web app was created using Flask. On the page the button was created to execute the scraping code and update the page with newest data
Bootstrap was used to polish and customize the web page and make it mobile-responsive
